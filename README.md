# talks
Collection of my talks built in reveal.js <br>
Slides are hosted at - https://modichirag.github.io/talks/xyz/#/
where xyz is the folder-name

To create a new presentation, the easy steps are - 
- copy an exisiting presentation except its reveal.js submodule
- add the submodule from main directory with git submodule add git@github.com:modichirag/reveal.js.git
- edit the .gitmodules file in parent directory to have https address for the submodule
- do git submodule update --init in the presentation folder and its reveal.js submodule
- cross fingers and commit
